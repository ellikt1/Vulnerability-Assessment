<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I utilized Tenable Nessus, a renowned vulnerability assessment tool, to conduct a comprehensive security scan on a Windows 10 virtual machine. The aim was to identify potential vulnerabilities and security issues within a controlled environment. The virtual machine was configured with a minimal set of applications, specifically Google Chrome and Microsoft Teams, to simulate a typical end-user scenario.
<br />
<br />

Objectives
 
 - <b>To understand the capabilities of Tenable Nessus in identifying security vulnerabilities. </b>
 - <b>To assess the security posture of a Windows 10 host with common applications installed. </b>
 - <b>To document the identified vulnerabilities and remediate the “critical” and “high” vulnerabilities.</b>



<h2>Scan Configuration</h2>
In order to effectively scan the Windows 10 virtual machine, it was necessary to configure Tenable Nessus with the appropriate settings. The process involved the following steps:
<br />
<br />
<b>Target Specification:</b>

 - To understand the capabilities of Tenable Nessus in identifying security vulnerabilities. 


<b>Credential Configuration:</b>
 
 - The Nessus vulnerability scanner was configured to perform a credentialed scan. By providing valid Windows credentials, the scanner was able to authenticate to the target system. This approach allowed for a deeper and more comprehensive analysis of the virtual machine, as it could access system files, registry settings, and configuration details that are not available through non-credentialed scans. With credentialed access, Nessus conducted an in-depth evaluation of the virtual machine, checking for missing patches, misconfigurations, insecure settings, and outdated software versions. This comprehensive approach significantly enhanced the scanner's ability to uncover vulnerabilities that would otherwise remain hidden in a standard, non-credentialed scan.

By configuring the Nessus scanner in this manner, the assessment provided a thorough understanding of the security posture of the Windows 10 host, enabling the identification of both surface-level and deep-rooted vulnerabilities. This comprehensive approach ensured that the findings were detailed and actionable, leading to more effective remediation strategies.
